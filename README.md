# 🚀 Machine Learning & Data Science Project Template

Welcome to the **ML/Data Science Project Template**! This repository provides a **structured setup** for your machine learning and data science projects, ensuring best practices, modularity, and ease of use.

---

## 📌 **Why Use This Template?**
This template helps you:
- ✅ **Organize** your ML projects efficiently
- ✅ **Standardize** workflows for reproducibility
- ✅ **Version control** datasets and experiments
- ✅ **Easily scale** and collaborate with others

## 🛠️ **Project Structure**
```
project-setup/
│── data/               # Data storage (raw, processed, external)
│── models/             # Trained models & checkpoints
│── notebooks/          # Jupyter notebooks for exploration & modeling
│── references/         # References & external resources
│── reports/            # Documentation & results
│── src/                # Source code (custom scripts, models, utilities)
│── .env.example        # Example environment variables
│── .gitignore          # Ignore unnecessary files
│── README.md           # Project overview
│── requirements.txt    # Dependencies
```

## 🔥 **Quickstart**
### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fahimulkabir/project-setup.git
cd project-setup
```

### **2️⃣ Set Up a Virtual Environment**
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

### **3️⃣ Install Dependencies**

## 🏗️ **Customization**
You can modify this template for your needs:
- Add **Docker** support
- Integrate **DVC** for dataset versioning
- Use **MLflow** for experiment tracking
- Include **FastAPI/Flask** for ML model deployment

---

## 📚 **Best Practices**
✔ Keep your data structured in `data/raw/`, `data/processed/`
✔ Store models in `models/`
✔ Document workflows with Jupyter notebooks in `notebooks/`
✔ Use `src/` for scripts and keep functions modular
✔ Maintain references in `references/`
✔ Track reports and results in `reports/`
✔ Use `.env.example` for environment variables
✔ Write tests and maintain clear **README.md** and documentation
